#CPU scheduling

FCFS: First Come First Serve 
SJF: Shortest Job First 
STCF: Shortest Time-to-Completion First (Preemptive) 

Perform FCFS, SJF and STCF scheduling algorithms. In the SJF and STCF I chose to perform some form of dynamic programming
thinking that it would be efficient and more real-life process scheduler. One could
have FCFS first to sort the list and then performed SJF and STCFs.
